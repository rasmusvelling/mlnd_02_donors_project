    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - We've seen naive bayes implemented on spam/ham classification of emails in the tutorial videos. But one could also apply the algorithm to other classification problems such as identifying wether an online visitor is going to make a purchase or not, or whether one will like a given movie on netflix or not.\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes (and Gaussian Naive Bayes) are simple models that are easy to understand (and thus intepret). This is both a strength and a weakness, but in many cases these simple models will perform well, and thus their strength lies in being a simple \"explanation\" to a lot of real world problems. Additionally the Gaussian NB is a fast (low run time) as we will see later.\n",
    "    - Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes gaussian distribution on real-valued inputs, and independence of inputs, this is ofcourse a pitfall if the input has another distribution (such as uniform) - or if the inputs are not independent.\n",
    "    - I think Gaussian Naive Bayes will fit the data well due to it's simplicity, and that it is able to handle many inputs (columns) easily.\n",
    "    - References: [blog post 1](https://medium.com/@LSchultebraucks/gaussian-naive-bayes-19156306079b), [blog post 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/classification-project-finding-donors-853db66fbb8c), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Bagging\n",
    "    - Bagging methods use a lot of individual models (by default decision trees in sklearn), each trained on a subset of the data, to build an overall model.\n",
    "    - Bagging tends to not overfitting and generalize well onto testing data. Also it handles many features well, and it is reasonably fast (as we will see later). One could also have chosen randomforest, which is very similar to bagging (when using trees as base_estimator) - which also do subset of features, to get an even better generalizing model.\n",
    "    - Bagging is tends to have a large bias (but does not in our case), so it is weak if low bias is desired. \n",
    "    - I have never tried the bagging algorithm and was curious as to how it works in implementation. I suspect it will perform well on the current data, since we are looking at binary outcomes, and I suspect overfitting will be the biggest problem for this dataset.\n",
    "    - References: [sci kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html), [blog post 3](http://vivekmishra1991.github.io/blog/2015/10/09/random-forest-feature-selection-metric/), [blog post 4](https://machinelearningmastery.com/bagging-and-random-forest-ensemble-algorithms-for-machine-learning/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - The kernel trick underlying Support Vector Machines is very sophisticated and clever, and SVM's can be used both for classification and for regression problems, and works well in cases with a high degree of nonlinearity in data. For classification this could be problems of classifying multiple income segments, where data is inherently skewed and nonlinear.\n",
    "    - As mentioned, a big strength of SVM is the ability to capture nonlinearity.\n",
    "    - SVM's weakness can be difficulty in tuning of hyperparamters and the likely possibilities of overfitting. Also it is slow due to the many calculations necessary for the kernel trickm as we will also see later.\n",
    "    - SVM are very differnet from Naive Bayes, and I think it would be interesting to apply two very distinct algorithms. I suspect that SVM will perform well, because it is a very sophisticated algorithm, that should be able to perform as well as the simpler models, if tuned correctly.\n",

    "The Bagging Classifier F-score is .684 in test, when 100% of training data is used. The similar F-score for SVC and GaussianNB are .674 and .421 respectively. Thus the Bagging Classifier shows a marginally better F-score than the SVC. And the run-time for the Bagging Classifier is significantly lower - which is not a main concern for us here, but still a nice bonus. Often in real life run time can become an issue, so given the same predictive performance, I would definitely choose the model with the lower runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting that the BaggingClassifier fits perfectly on the training, but still generalizes well to the testing set. Usually one could be worried that (close to) 100% accuracy on training data would be a sign of overfitting, and thus poor generalization on testing data. But is does not seem to be the case. I would however keep an eye on this.\n",

But I can see how these types of dynamics can be important and correlated, ie. \"intelligent, succesfull\" people also being \"attractive, married\" and having a \"good family\" and so on, or maybe the inverse, where people who are limited in resources don't have the energy to make a family and so on. These are just random thoughts, but it makes sense, that these type of correlations occur."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "1) The reduced model performs a bit worse than the optimized model on the full data set. But not a whole lot.\n",
    "2) If computational time was a big factor, it would make a lot of sense to use a reduce model. Especially in situation where one is trying to serve customers on a \"real-time\" basis, it would make sense to sacrifice a bit of performance for some improvements in speed - like on Netflix: people would probably not wait around for five minutes while the platforms comes up with movie recommendations, and it is doubtfull whether or not most people would even be able to perceive a performance difference of the magnitude we are talking about here."
